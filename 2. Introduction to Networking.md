### IP Addresses

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier that devices use to communicate with each other on a computer network.

#### IP Version 4

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and is the most commonly used version of IP. 
**When referring to IP, we 99% of the time refer to this one.**

An IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space") to 4.294.967.296 (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as [private networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network "Private network") (~18 million addresses) and [multicast addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address "Multicast address") (~270 million addresses).

It consists of four octets, with each octet represented in decimal form and ranging from 0 – 255. 
It can also be written in binary form, consisting of 32 bits and ranging from 00000000 – 11111111. 
It serves two main functions: network interface [identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(information) "Identification (information)") and location [addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address").

These octets can be used to calculate the number of hosts available on the network. 
A host is any device that has an IP address and is used to communicate over the network. 
In order for two hosts to communicate with each other, they must have the same subnet mask.

> For example: **192.168.1.1**

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |   
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |     

The above table is equal to 255

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |   
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 0  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |    

The above table is equal to 7

##### Classes
There are five classes of IPv4 addresses: A, B, C, D, and E.

-   Class A addresses have a range of 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0. The first octet is used to identify the network, and the last three octets are used to identify the host. Class A addresses are used for large networks with a large number of hosts.

-   **Class B** addresses have a range of 128.0.0.0 to 191.0.0.0. The first two octets are used to identify the network, and the last two octets are used to identify the host. Class B addresses are used for medium-sized networks with a moderate number of hosts.

-   **Class C** addresses have a range of 192.0.0.0 to 223.0.0.0. The first three octets are used to identify the network, and the last octet is used to identify the host. Class C addresses are used for small networks with a small number of hosts.

-   **Class D** addresses have a range of 224.0.0.0 to 239.0.0.0 and are reserved for multicast addresses. Multicast addresses are used to send a single packet to multiple destinations simultaneously.

-   **Class E** addresses have a range of 240.0.0.0 to 255.0.0.0 and are reserved for experimental or future use.

In a class D address, the network portion is represented by the first four octets and the host portion is not used. Class D addresses are used for multicast communications and are not used to identify individual hosts. Instead, they are used to identify a group of hosts that are interested in receiving the same multicast traffic.

#### IP Version 6 
IPv6 is the sixth version of the Internet Protocol and is designed to replace IPv4, which is quickly running out of available addresses due to the growth of the internet. 

In IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2<sup>128</sup> (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456) addresses. 
It is written in hexadecimal format.

> For example: **2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334**

#### IPv4 to IPv6

The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has been underway for a number of years, and is expected to continue for some time. IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which is the primary communication protocol used on the internet. It is based on a 32-bit address space, which allows for a total of about 4.3 billion unique addresses.

However, with the explosive growth of the internet and the proliferation of devices that use it, the pool of available IPv4 addresses has been depleted. This has led to the development of IPv6, which is based on a 128-bit address space and allows for a virtually limitless number of unique addresses.

IPv6 has been available since the late 1990s, and many internet service providers (ISPs) and other organizations have begun the process of transitioning to it. However, the transition has been slow due to the significant costs and technical challenges involved. Additionally, IPv4 is still widely used and supported, and there is a large installed base of devices and infrastructure that rely on it.

It is difficult to predict exactly when the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will be complete, as it will depend on a number of factors, including the rate of adoption of IPv6 by ISPs and other organizations, and the lifetime of existing IPv4 infrastructure. However, it is likely that the transition will continue for many years to come.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT)

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used to allow devices on a private network, such as a home network or corporate LAN, to communicate with the internet. NAT allows devices on the private network to use a single, shared IP address to access the internet, while still maintaining their own unique, private IP addresses on the local network.

**NAT was created to address the issue of the depletion of IPv4 addresses.** As the internet grew, the pool of available IPv4 addresses became depleted, and it became necessary to find ways to conserve these addresses. NAT allows organizations and individuals to use a single, public IP address for multiple devices on their private network, rather than having to assign a unique, public IP address to each device. This helps to conserve IPv4 addresses and allows for the efficient use of the remaining pool of addresses.

NAT is typically implemented by a NAT device, such as a router, that sits between the private network and the internet. When a device on the private network sends traffic to the internet, the NAT device translates the private IP address of the device into a public IP address, and vice versa when traffic is received from the internet. This allows devices on the private network to communicate with the internet, while still maintaining their private IP addresses and keeping them hidden from the public internet.

###### NAT Types 

> There are 3 types of NAT, each type of has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the appropriate type to use depends on the specific needs and requirements of the network.

##### Static NAT

This type of NAT creates a fixed, one-to-one mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address. This means that a device on the private network will always use the same public IP address to access the internet. Static NAT is useful in situations where a device on the private network needs to be reachable from the internet using a consistent, static IP address.

##### Dynamic NAT

This type of NAT creates a mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address from a pool of available addresses. When a device on the private network needs to access the internet, it is assigned a public IP address from the pool. When the device is no longer using the internet, the public IP address is returned to the pool for reuse. Dynamic NAT allows multiple devices on the private network to access the internet using a limited number of public IP addresses.

##### Port Address Translation (PAT) or Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)

This type of NAT creates a one-to-many mapping between a single public IP address and multiple private IP addresses. When a device on the private network sends traffic to the internet, the NAT device assigns a unique port number to the traffic, which allows it to be multiplexed over a single public IP address. This allows multiple devices on the private network to share a single public IP address and access the internet simultaneously. PAT is commonly used to conserve public IP addresses and allow multiple devices to access the internet using a limited number of addresses.


### MAC Addresses

A MAC address (or "Media Access Control" address) is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network. Every network interface card (NIC) in any device has its own unique MAC address that is used to identify the device on the network. The MAC address consists of six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens. 

> For example, 00:12:34:56:78:9A

### Subnetting

Subnetting is the process of breaking a large network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets. A subnet is a segmented portion of a larger network, which can be used to help divide the network into smaller and more efficient parts. By doing this, it allows for easier management of the overall network, as well as improved performance and better security of the individual parts. Subnetting is also used to reduce the size of broadcast domains by splitting them up into smaller logical groups. This can help prevent congestion on the network by limiting broadcast traffic and providing better control over who has access to certain parts of a network.

### OSI Model

The OSI Model, or Open Systems Interconnection model, is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. It is composed of 7 layers, each layer responsible for a different function in the communication process. 

1. **Physical** Layer (Data, Cables, Cat6)
Responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium. It includes the physical characteristics of the network such as cables, connectors, and network interface cards (NICs).

[[Physical Layer Protocols]]

2. **Data Link** Layer (Switching, MAC Addresses)
It provides reliable transmission of data across a physical link by using error-correction techniques. It also controls the flow of data by using protocols such as Ethernet and token ring.

[[Data Link Layer Protocols]]

3. **Network** Layer (IP Addresses, Routing)
It is responsible for routing packets from source to destination networks by using the best possible path. It also provides packet switching, flow control, and congestion control services.

[[Network Layer Protocols]]

4. **Transport** Layer (TCP/UDP)
It is responsible for providing end-to-end reliable delivery of data between two applications on different hosts by using connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and UDP. 

[[Transport Layer Protocols]]

5. **Session** Layer (Session Management)
It establishes, manages and terminates communication sessions between two applications on different hosts. 

[[Session Layer Protocols]]

6. **Presentation** Layer (WMV, JPEG, MOV)
It is responsible for formatting the data in a particular way before it is sent over the network to ensure compatibility between different systems on the network. 

[[Presentation Layer Protocols]]

7. **Application** Layer (HTTP, SMTP)
This layer provides services to user applications such as file transfer protocol (FTP), telnet, email, etc., that enable users to access information or resources available on other systems on the network.

[[Application Layer Protocols]]

> An easy way to remember all the seven layers is to take the first letter of each layer (PDNTSPA) and remember this phrase: 'Please, do not throw sausage pizza away'


### TCP, UDP and Three-Way Handshake

### TCP

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport layer protocol that is used to transmit data across a network. It is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it establishes a dedicated end-to-end connection between the sender and the receiver before transmitting data. This connection is maintained until the transmission is complete or the connection is terminated.

TCP is designed to provide reliable data transmission by ensuring that all data packets are acknowledged by the receiver and retransmitted if necessary. It uses a number of mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the transmission, including sequence numbers, checksums, and flow control.

TCP is used by a wide range of applications that require a reliable end-to-end connection, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and remote login. It is also used as a transport layer protocol in many other protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

One of the main advantages of TCP is its reliability. Because it establishes a connection and performs error checking, it is able to recover from packet loss and ensure that all data is transmitted correctly. This makes it ideal for applications that require a high level of reliability, such as email and file transfer.

However, the overhead associated with establishing and maintaining a connection and performing error checking can also be a disadvantage of TCP. It requires more resources and has higher overhead than other transport layer protocols such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which can lead to slower performance in certain situations.

### UDP

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a transport layer protocol that is used to transmit data across a network. It is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a dedicated end-to-end connection between the sender and the receiver before transmitting data. Instead, it sends packets of data called datagrams directly to the destination without establishing a connection or checking to see if the packets were received.

UDP is often used for real-time applications that require low latency and high speed, such as online gaming, video conferencing, and voice over IP (VoIP). It is also used for applications that do not require a reliable end-to-end connection, such as Domain Name System (DNS) queries and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) notifications.

One of the main advantages of UDP is its simplicity. Because it does not establish a connection or perform error checking, it requires fewer resources and has lower overhead than other transport layer protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This makes it ideal for applications that require high performance and low latency.

However, the lack of error checking and reliability can also be a disadvantage of UDP. If a packet is lost or corrupted, there is no mechanism to recover it or request a retransmission. This can lead to data loss and may make it less suitable for applications that require a high level of reliability.

### Common Ports and Protocols

#### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) common ports:

-   20 and 21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
-   22 - SSH (Secure Shell)
-   23 - Telnet
-   25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
-   53 - DNS (Domain Name System)
-   80 - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
-   110 - POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)
-   143 - IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol)
-   443 - HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
-   465 - SMTPS (SMTP Secure)
-   993 - IMAPS (IMAP Secure)
-   3389 - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

#### UDP (User Datagram Protocol) common ports:

-   53 - DNS (Domain Name System)
-   67 and 68: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
-   69: TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
-   123 - NTP (Network Time Protocol)
-   161 - SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

In general, TCP is more reliable but slower, while UDP is faster but less reliable. The choice of which protocol to use depends on the specific needs of the application transmitting the data.

### Three-Way Handshake

A three-way handshake, also known as a TCP handshake, is a process used by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to establish a connection between two devices before transmitting data. It involves the exchange of three messages between the devices, which are used to synchronize their sequence numbers and initiate the connection.

The three-way handshake consists of the following steps:

1.  The client (Computer A) sends a SYN (Synchronize) message to the server (Computer B), requesting the establishment of a connection. The SYN message includes a random initial sequence number (ISN) chosen by the client.

2.  The server responds with a SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) message, acknowledging the receipt of the SYN message and requesting the establishment of a connection. The SYN-ACK message includes its own ISN, which is chosen by the server, as well as the client's ISN plus one.

3.  The client responds with an ACK (Acknowledge) message, acknowledging the receipt of the SYN-ACK message and completing the three-way handshake. The ACK message includes the server's ISN plus one.

After the three-way handshake is complete, the devices can begin transmitting data over the connection. The three-way handshake is used to establish a connection between devices in both directions, so the process is repeated in reverse if data needs to be transmitted from the server to the client.

The three-way handshake is used by TCP to establish a connection because it ensures that both devices are ready to communicate and have synchronized their sequence numbers. It also allows each device to verify that the other device is alive and reachable.
