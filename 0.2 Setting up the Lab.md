### Installing the Virtual Machine
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a computer system. It allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, each operating system running in its own virtual environment.

Here's how it works: The host machine (the physical machine on which the VM is running) runs a hypervisor, which is a piece of software that manages the virtual machines. The hypervisor allocates hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to each virtual machine, and each VM runs as if it were a separate physical machine.

Virtual machines are useful because they allow you to test and run software on different operating systems or configurations without the need for multiple physical machines. They are commonly used for development and testing, as well as for running multiple applications on a single machine.

Some benefits of using virtual machines include the ability to easily switch between operating systems, the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single machine, and the ability to run different applications or configurations on the same hardware without interference.

### Installing the Operating System
These are the 2 most used OS for Pen-testing and Ethical Hacking and are the ones I most recommend. Although you can use almost any operating system (although it will take more time to set up and prepare the environment)

These operating systems are ready-to-go and comes with a bunch of tools that we will be using through our path.
