There are several pieces of hardware that may be necessary for an on-site pentest, also known as a penetration test or ethical hacking exercise. Here is a list of some of the most common hardware that a pentester might bring with them on an on-site engagement:

1.  **Laptop**
	A powerful laptop with a good processor, plenty of RAM, and a large hard drive is essential for running various tools and software that are used during a pentest.
2.  **External hard drive**
	An external hard drive can be used to store data and tools that are too large to fit on the laptop's hard drive.
3.  **USB drive**
	A USB drive can be used to store and transfer data and tools between the laptop and the target system.
4.  **Networking equipment**
	A pentester may need to bring various networking equipment, such as Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi and Network adapters, and switches, in order to connect to and test the target network.
5.  **Mobile device**
	A mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, can be useful for testing mobile applications and performing remote testing.
6.  **Security tools**
	A pentester will likely bring a variety of security tools, such as vulnerability scanners, password cracking tools, and packet sniffers, in order to test the security of the target system.


It's worth noting that the specific hardware that a pentester brings on an engagement may vary based on the specific goals and scope of the test.
