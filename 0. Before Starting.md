### Effective Note Keeping

If you wanna be successful in your career, and you wanna be successful in this course, you really need to take good notes.

Here are some tips for keeping efficient notes:

1.  Use a consistent system: Some people prefer to take notes on paper, while others prefer to use a digital note-taking tool like a computer or smartphone. Choose the method that works best for you and your learning style and stick with it. This could be something as simple as using a notebook or creating digital folders on your computer.

	Here are some of the best applications I've tried and can recommend:
	- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
	- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)
	- [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/download)
	- [CherryTree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/#downl)

2. Take clear, concise notes: When taking notes, focus on writing down the most important information and avoiding unnecessary details. Use *abbreviations* and *symbols* to save space, and try to use your own words as much as possible. 
3. Keep your notes organized: Keep your notes organized by date or topic. This will make it easier to find specific information when you need it.
4.  Use headings and subheadings: Organizing your notes with headings and subheadings can help you quickly find and review specific information.
5.  Highlight or underline important points: Use highlighting or underlining to draw attention to the most important points in your notes. This can help you quickly review the most important information.
6.  Review your notes regularly: Set aside time to review your notes on a regular basis, whether it's immediately after a class or lecture, or a few days later. This will help you retain the information and identify any gaps in your understanding.
7. Use multimedia tools: If you learn better through visual or auditory means, consider using multimedia tools such as mind maps, diagrams, or audio recordings to supplement your notes.
8.  Use the Cornell method: The Cornell method involves dividing your notes into three sections: a narrow left-hand margin, a wide right-hand margin, and a summary at the bottom. The left-hand margin is for key points, the right-hand margin is for elaboration and examples, and the summary at the bottom is a quick review of the main points. This method can help you review and retain information more effectively.

### Coding Best Practices

There are many best practices that software developers should follow when writing code in order to produce high-quality, maintainable, and efficient software. Some of these best practices include:

#### Code Clean
This means to write clean and readable code.

##### Naming Convictions
Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and other code elements.
By following a consistent naming convention, you can make the code easier to read and understand, and you can help to prevent naming conflicts and confusion.

For example, you might use camel case (e.g., "myVariable") for variables, snake case (e.g., "my_function") for functions, and all capital letters with underscores (e.g., "MY_CONSTANT") for constants.

*This varies on each Programming language.*

##### Indentation, Line Breaks and Whitespaces

This will make the code easy to read and understand.

**Indentation**: How the code should be indented, such as the use of tabs or spaces, and the number of spaces or tabs to use.

**Line breaks**: How to separate logical sections of the code and to keep the code within a certain length. This will help to prevent the code from becoming too long or difficult to read.

**Whitespace**: How to use whitespace within the code, such as the use of blank lines to separate code blocks or the use of spaces to align code elements.

##### Brackets and Statements Placement 
###### Bracket placement
Refers to the way in which brackets are used to enclose code blocks, such as blocks of statements or functions. There are two main styles for bracket placement:

- **Allman Style**
In the Allman style, brackets are placed on their own line, and the code block is indented one level from the surrounding code. This style is sometimes also called "Egyptian brackets."

```
if (a == b)
{
    // code block
}
```

- **K&R Style**
In the K&R style (named after the authors of "The C Programming Language"), brackets are placed on the same line as the code block they enclose.

```
if (a == b) {
    // code block
}
```

###### Statement placement
Refers to the way in which statements are written within the code. There are two main styles for statement placement:

- **One statement per line**
In this style, each statement is written on its own line, and the statements are separated by line breaks.

```
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = a + b;
```

- **Multiple statements per line**
In this style, multiple statements are written on the same line, and they are separated by semicolons.

```
a = 1; b = 2; c = a + b;
```

##### Follow a Coding Style

There are a lot of Coding Styles out there. Which style you choose is a matter of personal preference, and there is no one "right" way to do it. However, it is important to choose a style and stick to it consistently throughout the codebase, to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.

This applies wherever you are coding alone or working on a large group, always use the same coding style to ensure that the code is consistent, easy to read and understand, and easy to maintain.

##### Write Comments and Documentation

Use comments and documentation to explain what the code does and how it works. By adding comments to the code, you can make it easier not only for other developers to understand and maintain the code, but also for you in the future, and you can help to prevent misunderstandings or miscommunications. It is generally a good idea to comment the code at a high level, explaining the overall structure and purpose of the code, as well as at a more detailed level, explaining the specific functions and algorithms that are being used. This will make it easier to maintain and update.

#### Code Simple

It is generally a good idea to keep the code as simple and straightforward as possible. This can help to improve the readability and maintainability of the code, and it can also help to reduce the risk of errors and bugs. To keep the code simple, you should try to avoid using complex algorithms or data structures unless they are necessary, and you should try to minimize the use of global variables and state.

#### Code Control

Use a version control system (such as Git) to track changes to the code and collaborate with other developers. This allows you to revert changes if necessary and keep a record of who made each change.

#### Code Portability

Portability is the ability of the code to run on different platforms or environments. By writing portable code, you can ensure that the code can be easily deployed and run on a variety of systems. To make the code portable, you should try to avoid using platform-specific features or libraries, and you should use standardized interfaces and protocols whenever possible.

#### Code Scalability

Scalability is the ability of the code to handle an increasing workload without a corresponding increase in performance degradation. By writing scalable code, you can ensure that the code can handle a growing number of users or data without experiencing performance issues. To make the code scalable, you should try to minimize the use of resources, such as memory and CPU time, and you should design the code to be modular and flexible, so that it can be easily scaled up or down as needed.

#### Code Reusability

Reusability is the ability of the code to be used in different contexts or projects. By writing reusable code, you can save time and resources by avoiding the need to write new code for similar tasks. Break the code down into smaller, self-contained modules that can be easily reused in other projects. This helps to make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

#### Use Testing and Debugging Tools

Use testing tools to ensure that the code is correct and reliable, and use debugging tools to identify and fix problems.

#### Follow Security Best Practices

Follow best practices for writing secure code, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent vulnerabilities and attacks.

#### Read the Documentation/Manual of the Language/Tool you are using

Reading the documentation and manuals for a programming language can help you understand the syntax and semantics of the language, as well as the standard libraries and frameworks that are available. This can help you write better code and avoid common mistakes. Similarly, reading the documentation and manuals for a tool can help you understand how to use the tool effectively and efficiently, and how to troubleshoot problems that may arise.

By following these best practices, you can write code that is of high quality, easy to understand and maintain, and efficient. This will help you to produce software that is reliable, robust, and scalable.
