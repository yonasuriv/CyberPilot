### What's the difference between User Land and Kernel
Kernel space is strictly reserved for running a privileged operating system kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers. In contrast, user space is the memory area where application software and some drivers execute.

User land is the part of an operating system that runs user applications and provides the interface between them and the underlying hardware. It is responsible for managing resources, providing services, and ensuring security. Kernel is the core of an operating system that provides low-level services, such as memory management, task scheduling, device management, and system calls. It acts as a bridge between user applications and hardware components. The kernel manages access to resources and ensures that each application runs in isolation from other applications.
