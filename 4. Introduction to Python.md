### Indentation

Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. 
Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

> **Making use of a correct indentation will not only make your program not resort to errors, but it is one of the good practices of a programmer.**

### Comments

Comments can be used to explain the code, make the it more readable or to prevent execution when testing.
Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them:

```
# This is a commentary
# Everything here will be ignored by python
# This is usefull to explain what your script is doing
```

Python actually does not support multiline comments, but you can use multiline strings (not quite as intended)
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it. *(see **Strings**)*

### Variables
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular _type_, and can even change type after they have been set.
- String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
- Variable names are case-sensitive.

#### Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

-   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
-   A variable name cannot start with a number
-   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
-   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

**Example of legal variable names:**

> myvar = "John"  
> my_var = "John"  
> _my_var = "John"  
> myVar = "John"  
> MYVAR = "John"  
> myvar2 = "John"

**Example of illegal variable names:**

> 2myvar = "John"  
> my-var = "John"  
> my var = "John"

##### Many Values to Multiple Variables
`x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"`

##### One Value to Multiple Variables
`x = y = z = "Orange"`

#### Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.

Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

If you create a global variable and a variable inside a function with the same name, the global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

```
x = "awesome"  
  
def myfunc():  
  x = "fantastic"  
  print("Python is " + x)  
  
myfunc()  
  
print("Python is " + x)
```

This will print:

```
Python is fantastic
Python is awesome
```

### Data Types

| Type     | Value                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Text     | str                          |
| Numeric  | int, float, complex          |
| Sequence | list, tuple, range           |
| Mapping  | dict                         |
| Set      | set, frozenset               |
| Boolean  | bool                         |
| Binary   | bytes, bytearray, memoryview |
| None     | NoneType                     |

- The data type is automatically set when you assign a value to a variable
- If you want to specify the data type, you can use the constructor functions:
   - *Example: `x = str("Hello World")`*
- To verify the type of any object in Python, use the `type()` function

### Numbers
There are 3 types of numbers in python:

#### Int
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

```
x = 1.10  
y = 1.0  
z = -35.59
```

#### Float
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

```
x = 35e3  
y = 12E4  
z = -87.7e100
```

#### Complex
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part

```
x = 3+5j  
y = 5j  
z = -5j
```

> - You can convert from one type to another with the `int()`, `float()`, and `complex()` methods.
> - You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

### Math

| Type      | Symbol | Details                   |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Add       | +      |                        |
| Substract | -      |                        |
| Multiply  | *      |                        |
| Exponent  | **     |                        |
| Divide    | /      | with remainder (float) |
| Divide    | //     | no remainder           |
| Modulo    | %      | take what is left over |

### Strings

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
`'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`

You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes (either single or double):

```
"""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,  
consectetur adipiscing elit,  
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt  
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
```

#### String Indexing and Slicing
You can access individual characters in a string using indexing, or a range of characters using slicing. String indexing starts at 0, so the first character of a string has an index of 0. For example:

```
s = "Hello, World!"

# Get the first character of the string
print(s[0])  # Output: "H"

# Get the last character of the string
print(s[-1])  # Output: "!"

# Get a range of characters (slicing)
print(s[2:5])  # Output: "llo"
```


You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
   - Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

```
b = "Hello, World!"  
print(b[2:5])
```

> The first character has index 0.

##### Slice from the start
Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):

```
b = "Hello, World!"  
print(b[:5])
```

By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character.

##### Slice to the end
Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

```
b = "Hello, World!"  
print(b[2:])
```

By leaving out the _end_ index, the range will go to the end

##### Negative Indexing
Get the characters: From: "o" in "World!" (position -5), to, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

```
b = "Hello, World!"  
print(b[-5:-2])
```

Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string

#### String Concatenation
- To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
- To add a space between them, add a `" "`.

#### String Formatting
In Python, we cannot combine strings and numbers. 
But we can combine strings and numbers by using the `format()` method!

The `format()` method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders `{}` are:

```
age = 36  
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"  
print(txt.format(age))
```

The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:

```
quantity = 3  
itemno = 567  
price = 49.95  
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."  
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```

You can use index numbers `{0}` to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:

```
quantity = 3  
itemno = 567  
price = 49.95  
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."  
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
```

#### String Methods *(Advanced Strings)*
There are various methods available in Python to manipulate strings. Some common ones include `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and `split()`. Here's an example of using some of these methods:

```
s = "   Hello, World!   "

# Convert the string to uppercase
print(s.upper())  # Output: "   HELLO, WORLD!   "

# Convert the string to lowercase
print(s.lower())  # Output: "   hello, world!   "

# Strip leading and trailing whitespace
print(s.strip())  # Output: "Hello, World!"

# Replace a substring with another string
print(s.replace("World", "Universe"))  # Output: "   Hello, Universe!   "

# Split the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter
print(s.split(","))  # Output: ["   Hello", " World!   "]
```

### Escape Characters
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
An escape character is a backslash `\` followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes.

You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

```
txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
```

To fix this problem, use the escape character `\"`:

```
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
```

#### List of all Escape Characters

| Code   | Result          |
| ------ | --------------- |
| `\'`   | Single Quote    |
| `\\`   | Backlash        |
| `\n`    | New Line        |
| `\r`    | Carriage Return |
| `\t`    | Tab             |
| `\b`    | Backspace       |
| `\f`    | Form Feed       |
| `\ooo`       | Octal value     |
| `\xhh` | Hex value       |

### Casting
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

- `int()` - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)

```
x = int(1)   # x will be 1  
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2  
z = int("3") # z will be 3
```

- `float()` - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)

```
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0  
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8  
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0  
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2
```

- `str()` - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

```
x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'  
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'  
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
```


### Functions
- A a function is defined using the `def` keyword
- To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis

```
def my_function():  
  print("Hello from a function")  
  
my_function()
```

#### Arguments *(or Paramenters)*
- Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
- Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
- A function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.
- 
##### The terms _parameter_ and _argument_ can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

> Arguments are often shortened to _args_ in Python documentations.

#### Keyword Arguments
You can also send arguments with the _key_ = _value_ syntax. This way the order of the arguments does not matter.

```
def my_function(child3, child2, child1):  
  print("The youngest child is " + child3)  
  
my_function(child1 = "Emil", child2 = "Tobias", child3 = "Linus")
```

#### Arbitrary Arguments
If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a `*` before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a _tuple_ of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

```
def my_function(*kids):  
  print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])  
  
my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")
```

### Logical Conditions
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

-   Equals: `a == b`
-   Not Equals: `a != b`
-   Less than: `a < b`
-   Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
-   Greater than: `a > b`
-   Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

### Booleans
In programming you often need to know if an expression is `True` or `False`.
   - You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one any of these two answers.
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer.
   - These are done by using the logical conditions explained above.

```
print(10 > 9)  
print(10 == 9)  
print(10 < 9)
```

##### Most Values are True
Almost any value is evaluated to `True` if it has some sort of content.
- Any string is `True`, except empty strings.
- Any number is `True`, except `0`.
- Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are `True`, except empty ones.

##### Some Values are False
In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to `False`, except:
- Empty values, such as `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `""`, 
- The number `0`
- The value `None`
- And of course the value `False` evaluates to `False`.

#### Truth Table of Python

### Conditional Statements *(If...Else)*
##### If
If the condition is true, do something.

```
a = 33  
b = 200  
if b > a:  
  print("b is greater than a")
```

##### Elif
The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

```
a = 33  
b = 33  
if b > a:  
  print("b is greater than a")  
elif a == b:  
  print("a and b are equal")

```

##### Else
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

```
a = 200  
b = 33  
if b > a:  
  print("b is greater than a")  
elif a == b:  
  print("a and b are equal")  
else:  
  print("a is greater than b")
```

##### Nested if
You can have `if` statements inside `if` statements, this is called _nested_ `if` statements.

```
x = 41  
  
if x > 10:  
  print("Above ten,")  
  if x > 20:  
    print("and also above 20!")  
  else:  
    print("but not above 20.")
```

##### And
The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:

```
a = 200  
b = 33  
c = 500  
if a > b and c > a:  
  print("Both conditions are True")
```

##### Or
The `or` keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:

```
a = 200  
b = 33  
c = 500  
if a > b or a > c:  
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")
```

##### Pass
`if` statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an `if` statement with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

```
a = 33  
b = 200  
  
if b > a:  
  pass
```

#### **Ternary Operators** or **Conditional Expressions**.
##### Short Hand If
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

```
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
```

##### Short Hand If...Else
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

```
a = 2  
b = 330  
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
```

You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:

*One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:*

```
a = 330  
b = 330  
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
```

### Data Collection *(Lists, Tuple, Set, Dictionary)*

Python has 4 built-in data types to store collections of Data, all with different qualities and usage.

#### Lists
Lists are created using square brackets:

```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
print(thislist)
```

List items are **ordered**, **changeable**, and **allow duplicate values**.
List items are **indexed**, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

##### Ordered
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

> There are some [list methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_methods.asp) that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

##### Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

##### Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]  
print(thislist)
```

#### Tuples
Tuples are written with round brackets:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")  
print(thistuple)
```

Tuple items are **ordered**, **unchangeable**, and **allow duplicate values**.
Tuple items are **indexed**, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

##### Ordered
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

##### Unchangeable
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

##### Allow Duplicates
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

#### Sets
Sets are written with curly brackets:

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}  
print(thisset)
```

A set is a collection which is **unordered**, **unchangeable**, and **do not allow duplicates**.
Sets are **unindexed**.

- Set  _items_ are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
- Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

##### Unordered

Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

##### Unchangeable

Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

##### Duplicates Not Allowed

Sets cannot have two items with the same value.


```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}  
  
print(thisset)
```

The output of the example above will be:

```
{'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}
```

#### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

```
thisdict = {  
  "brand": "Ford",  
  "model": "Mustang",  
  "year": 1964  
}  
print(thisdict)
```

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is **ordered**, **changeable** and **do not allow duplicates**.

> As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are _ordered_. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are _unordered_.

##### Ordered or Unordered?
When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

##### Changeable

Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

##### Duplicates Not Allowed

Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key, if it does, the first value will be overwritten:

```
thisdict = {  
  "brand": "Ford",  
  "model": "Mustang",  
  "year": 1964,  
  "year": 2020  
}  
print(thisdict)
```

### Looping *(For, While)*

#### While Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```
i = 1  
while i < 6:  
  print(i)  
  i += 1
```

> Remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.

The `while` loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, `i`, which we set to 1.

##### Break Statement
With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

*Exit the loop when i is 3*

```
i = 1  
while i < 6:  
  print(i)  
  if i == 3:  
    break  
  i += 1
```

##### Continue Statement
With the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

*Continue to the next iteration if i is 3*

```
i = 0  
while i < 6:  
  i += 1  
  if i == 3:  
    continue  
  print(i)
```


##### Else Statement
With the `else` statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

*Print a message once the condition is false*

```
i = 1  
while i < 6:  
  print(i)  
  i += 1  
else:  
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
```



#### For Loops
A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

*Print each fruit in a fruit list*

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
for x in fruits:  
  print(x)
```

The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

##### Break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:

*Exit the loop when `x` is "banana"*

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
for x in fruits:  
  print(x)  
  if x == "banana":  
    break
```

*Exit the loop when `x` is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print*

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
for x in fruits:  
  if x == "banana":  
    break  
  print(x)
```

*This will only print "apple"*

##### Continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

*Do not print banana*

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
for x in fruits:  
  if x == "banana":  
    continue  
  print(x)
```

##### Pass Statement
`for` loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a `for` loop with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

```
for x in [0, 1, 2]:  
  pass
```

##### Else Statement
The `else` keyword in a `for` loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

*Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended*

```
for x in range(6):  
  print(x)  
else:  
  print("Finally finished!")
```

> The `else` block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a `break` statement.

```
for x in range(6):  
  if x == 3: break  
  print(x)  
else:  
  print("Finally finished!")
```

##### Range Function

To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the `range()` function,

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

```
for x in range(6):  
  print(x)
```

> Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.

The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):

```
for x in range(2, 6):  
  print(x)
```

The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, **3**):

```
for x in range(2, 30, 3):  
  print(x)
```

##### Nested Loops
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

*Print each adjective for every fruit*

```
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]  
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
  
for x in adj:  
  for y in fruits:  
    print(x, y)
```


### Modules
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
It's file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

#### Built-in Modules
There are several built-in modules in Python, which you can import whenever you like.


```
import platform

x = platform.system()
print(x)
```

#### Creating a Module
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension `.py`

*Save this code in a file named `mymodule.py`*

```
def greeting(name):  
  print("Hello, " + name)
```

#### Using a Module
Now we can use the module we just created, by using the `import` statement:

```
import mymodule  
  
mymodule.greeting("Jonathan")
```

> When using a function from a module, use the syntax: _module_name.function_name_.

#### Naming a Module
You can name the module file whatever you like, but it must have the file extension `.py`

#### Re-naming a Module

You can create an **alias** when you import a module, by using the `as` keyword

*Create an alias for `mymodule` called `mx`*

```
import mymodule as mx  
  
a = mx.person1["age"]  
print(a)
```

#### Import From Module
You can choose to import only parts from a module, by using the `from` keyword.

*The module named `mymodule` has one function and one dictionary:*

```
def greeting(name):  
  print("Hello, " + name)  
  
person1 = {  
  "name": "John",  
  "age": 36,  
  "country": "Norway"  
}
```

*Import only the person1 dictionary from the module*

```
from mymodule import person1  
  
print (person1["age"])
```

> When importing using the `from` keyword, do not use the module name when referring to elements in the module. Example: `person1["age"]`, **not** `mymodule.person1["age"]`

#### Variables in Module
The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc):

*Save this code in the file `mymodule.py`*

```
person1 = {  
  "name": "John",  
  "age": 36,  
  "country": "Norway"  
}
```

*Import the module named mymodule, and access the person1 dictionary:*

```
import mymodule  
  
a = mymodule.person1["age"]  
print(a)
```

##### Dir Function


There is a built-in function to list all the function names (or variable names) in a module. The `dir()` function:

```
import platform  
  
x = dir(platform)  
print(x)
```

> The `dir()` function can be used on _all_ modules, also the ones you create yourself.
