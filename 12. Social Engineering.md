Social engineering attacks are a type of cyber attack that rely on human interaction and often involve manipulating or tricking people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that may compromise the security of an organization. Here are some basic keys to perform a social engineering attack:

1.  Research: It is important to gather as much information as possible about the target organization and its employees in order to tailor the attack and increase the chances of success. This may involve researching the organization's policies, procedures, and employee roles, as well as searching for personal information about individual employees.
2.  Identify vulnerabilities: Look for ways to exploit the natural human tendency to trust, such as by posing as an authority figure or creating a sense of urgency or fear. Identifying the vulnerabilities of the target organization and its employees can help you tailor your attack and increase the chances of success.
3.  Use language and tone to your advantage: Pay attention to the words you use and the tone of your voice when communicating with your target. Using language and tone that is appropriate for the situation and that aligns with the expectations of your target can help you gain their trust and convince them to divulge sensitive information or perform actions that may compromise their organization
