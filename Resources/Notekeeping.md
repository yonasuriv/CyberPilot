If you wanna be successful in your career, and you wanna be successful in this course, you really need to take good notes.

Here are some tips for keeping efficient notes:

1.  Use a consistent system: Some people prefer to take notes on paper, while others prefer to use a digital note-taking tool like a computer or smartphone. Choose the method that works best for you and your learning style and stick with it. This could be something as simple as using a notebook or creating digital folders on your computer.

	Here are some of the best applications I've tried and can recommend:

2. Take clear, concise notes: When taking notes, focus on writing down the most important information and avoiding unnecessary details. Use *abbreviations* and *symbols* to save space, and try to use your own words as much as possible. 
3. Keep your notes organized: Keep your notes organized by date or topic. This will make it easier to find specific information when you need it.
4.  Use headings and subheadings: Organizing your notes with headings and subheadings can help you quickly find and review specific information.
5.  Highlight or underline important points: Use highlighting or underlining to draw attention to the most important points in your notes. This can help you quickly review the most important information.
6.  Review your notes regularly: Set aside time to review your notes on a regular basis, whether it's immediately after a class or lecture, or a few days later. This will help you retain the information and identify any gaps in your understanding.
7. Use multimedia tools: If you learn better through visual or auditory means, consider using multimedia tools such as mind maps, diagrams, or audio recordings to supplement your notes.
8.  Use the Cornell method: The Cornell method involves dividing your notes into three sections: a narrow left-hand margin, a wide right-hand margin, and a summary at the bottom. The left-hand margin is for key points, the right-hand margin is for elaboration and examples, and the summary at the bottom is a quick review of the main points. This method can help you review and retain information more effectively.
