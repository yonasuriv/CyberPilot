The data link layer is the second layer of the [[OSI Model]], which is a framework for understanding how networked devices communicate with each other. The data link layer is responsible for providing reliable delivery of data frames between devices on the same network segment. It is responsible for physically transmitting data over the link between devices, as well as for providing error detection and correction, flow control, and media access control.

There are many different data link layer protocols that are used to transmit data over different types of physical media. Some examples of data link layer protocols include:

-   Ethernet: A data link layer protocol that uses frame check sequences (FCS) to detect errors and retransmit damaged frames. It also uses a media access control (MAC) scheme called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to manage access to the shared network medium.
-   Wi-Fi: A data link layer protocol that uses frame check sequences (FCS) to detect errors and retransmit damaged frames. It also uses a media access control (MAC) scheme called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to manage access to the shared wireless medium.
-   Bluetooth: A data link layer protocol that uses a combination of error detection and correction techniques to ensure reliable delivery of data. It also uses a media access control (MAC) scheme called Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) to manage access to the shared wireless medium.
-   PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): A data link layer protocol that is used to establish a connection over a point-to-point link, such as a dial-up modem or a serial link. It includes features for error detection and correction, compression, and authentication.
-   ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode): A data link layer protocol that uses fixed-size cells to transmit data over high-speed connections. It includes features for error detection and correction, flow control, and quality of service (QoS).

Each of these data link layer protocols has its own set of characteristics, including the type of physical media it uses, the transmission speed it supports, and the error detection and correction mechanisms it employs. Data link layer protocols are typically implemented in hardware, such as network interface cards (NICs) or modems, and they are often designed to be compatible with specific types of network media and equipment.
