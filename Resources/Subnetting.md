Subnetting is the process of breaking a large network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets. A subnet is a segmented portion of a larger network, which can be used to help divide the network into smaller and more efficient parts. By doing this, it allows for easier management of the overall network, as well as improved performance and better security of the individual parts. Subnetting is also used to reduce the size of broadcast domains by splitting them up into smaller logical groups. This can help prevent congestion on the network by limiting broadcast traffic and providing better control over who has access to certain parts of a network.

netmask 255.255.255.0

*Example of a /24 or wack24 network*

If all of the ones are switched on, we've got a 255.
If none of the ones are switched on, we've got a 0.

They have to be switched in order (from left to right)
