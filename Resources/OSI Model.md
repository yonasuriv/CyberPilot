The OSI Model, or Open Systems Interconnection model, is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. It is composed of 7 layers, each layer responsible for a different function in the communication process. 

1. **Physical** Layer (Data, Cables, Cat6)
Responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium. It includes the physical characteristics of the network such as cables, connectors, and network interface cards (NICs).

[[Physical Layer Protocols]]

2. **Data Link** Layer (Switching, MAC Addresses)
It provides reliable transmission of data across a physical link by using error-correction techniques. It also controls the flow of data by using protocols such as Ethernet and token ring.

3. **Network** Layer (IP Addresses, Routing)
It is responsible for routing packets from source to destination networks by using the best possible path. It also provides packet switching, flow control, and congestion control services.

[[Network Layer Protocols]]

4. **Transport** Layer (TCP/UDP)
It is responsible for providing end-to-end reliable delivery of data between two applications on different hosts by using connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and UDP. 

[[Transport Layer Protocols]]

5. **Session** Layer (Session Management)
It establishes, manages and terminates communication sessions between two applications on different hosts. 

[[Session Layer Protocols]]

6. **Presentation** Layer (WMV, JPEG, MOV)
It is responsible for formatting the data in a particular way before it is sent over the network to ensure compatibility between different systems on the network. 

[[Presentation Layer Protocols]]

7. **Application** Layer (HTTP, SMTP)
This layer provides services to user applications such as file transfer protocol (FTP), telnet, email, etc., that enable users to access information or resources available on other systems on the network.

> An easy way to remember all the seven layers is to take the first letter of each layer (PDNTSPA) and remember this phrase: 'Please, do not throw sausage pizza away'
