A MAC address (or "Media Access Control" address) is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network. Every network interface card (NIC) in any device has its own unique MAC address that is used to identify the device on the network. The MAC address consists of six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens.
