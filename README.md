## About

#### **This is the first course written using GPT.**

GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a type of large, deep learning language model developed by OpenAI. It is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of words, given the context of the previous words. It is known for its ability to generate human-like text, making it useful for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

GPT has been updated several times since it was first released, with the most recent version being GPT-5.
